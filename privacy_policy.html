  <h1>Privacy Policy for numfyx</h1>
  <p>Last updated: 17 January 2026</p>

  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>numfyx is an offline app that reformats phone numbers in your device contacts to international E.164 format. The app performs all processing locally on your device and does not upload contact data or phone numbers to any server.</p>

  <h2>Permissions</h2>
  <p>The app requests the following permissions only as required for its features:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Contacts</strong> (read and write) — Used to read contacts that contain phone numbers and to write formatted phone numbers back to your contacts when you choose to apply the changes.</li>
    <li><strong>Storage / Media</strong> — Used only when the user exports results (PDF or CSV) and explicitly chooses to save or open an exported file. The app does not access media in the background.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Data Collected</h2>
  <p>The app accesses contact names and phone numbers only when you grant permission and only to perform the formatting operation you initiate. The app does not collect, store externally, or transmit contacts or phone numbers to any remote server.</p>

  <h2>Exported Files</h2>
  <p>If you export results, the app generates a local PDF and optionally a CSV file and saves it to your device. You can open or share the exported file using apps on your device. Exported files are not uploaded by numfyx.</p>

  <h2>Third-party services</h2>
  <p>numfyx does not send data to third-party analytics or crash-reporting services. If you add any third-party services in future releases, this policy will be updated and reflected on this page.</p>

  <h2>Retention</h2>
  <p>Contact data is processed in-memory during the formatting operation. The app writes formatted numbers back to your local contacts only when you approve changes. numfyx does not retain a copy of your contacts or phone numbers outside your device's contact storage.</p>

  <h2>User control</h2>
  <p>You control when processing runs, which contacts are selected for export or update, and whether exported files are created. You can revoke permissions at any time from your device settings.</p>

  <h2>Contact</h2>
  <p>If you have questions about this policy, contact: yokwejuste@gmail.com</p>

  <h2>Changes to this policy</h2>
  <p>We may update this privacy policy to reflect changes in the app. The latest version will always be available on this page.</p>
